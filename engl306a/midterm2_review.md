# CH 4 (Part II): Complex Event Schema
### 4.2.6 The "moving" schema
Combination of either then happening schema or the doing schema and outlines: 
```mermaid 
graph LR;
A(Source: where the proccess/action starts) --> B(Path: where it passes); 
B(Path: where it passes) --> C(Goal: where it goes);
```
The **source-path-goal** schema

| Example | Explanation |
|---|---|
| The apple fell from the tree into the grass. | *“happening” schema + Source – Goal* |
| I climbed from my room up the ladder onto the roof. | *“doing” schema + Source – Path – Goal* |
| It went on from ten all night long till two. | *“happening” schema + Start – Duration – End* |
| She changed from an admirer into his adversary. | *“happening” schema + Initial State – Resultant State* |

**Path** in a concrete *spatial* sense can also be:
- **duration** concept in a *temporal* context
- **two successive states** of being in a *proccess* context

For human actions, there is a **goal-over-source** principle:
$$goal > source \text{ }\text{  and  }\text{ } source \text{, } goal > path$$

### 4.2.7 The "transferring" schema
Combination of different schemas: the "having", "happening" or "doing" schema, and yhe "moving" schema

```mermaid
graph LR;
A(Initial state: one participant has something) --> B(passes it on to another participant); 
B --> C(Resultant state: second participant has the thing passes on to)
```

| Example | Explanation |
|---|---|
| Janice gave Lynn a birthday cake. | Lynn becomes a real possesssor of the entity - she is a *reciever* |
| Jance gave a birthday cake to Lynn. | In this case, Lynn could be a temporary possessor - she is a *Goal*, not nessessarily a reciever |
| Janice gave the door a coat of paint | Door is a *reciver* |

In summary, generally: 
1. X gave Y some Z - Y is a reciever of Z
2. X gave Z to some Y - Y is a goal for Z
