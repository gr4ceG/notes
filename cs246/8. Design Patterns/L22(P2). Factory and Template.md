# Factory Patter Method
Problem: write a video game with two types of enemies, turtles and bullets, the system randomely sends turtles and bullets, but bullets become more frequent in later levels.

Since we never know exactly what enemy comes next, we don't want to call constructors directly. Moreover, we don't want to hardcode the decision policy, as we want it to be customizable.

So instead, we put a factory method in `Level` that creates enemies. 

```c++
class Level {
    public:
        virtual Enemy *createEnemy();
}

class NormalLevel : public Level{
    public:
        Enemy *createEnemy() override {
            // create mostly turtles
        }
}; 

class Castle: public Level {
    public:
        Enemy *createEnemy() override() {
            // create mostly bullets
        }
}
```

# Template Method Pattern
Used when we want subclasses to override some aspects of superclass behaviour, but other aspects must stay the same.

*Example.* There are `Red` and `Green` turtles subclasses shouldn't change the way a turtle's head and feet are drswn, but can change the trawing of the shell.
